# Fruit Samurai
Welcome to Fruit Samurai! This is a web-based game project developed for our Software Engineering course at University of Luxembourg. In this project, we've created a game inspired by the popular Fruit Ninja, but with our own unique twist.

## Introduction
Fruit Samurai is a fun and interactive game where players use a virtual samurai sword to slice various bamboos that are thrown onto the screen. The objective is simple: slice as many bamboos as possible while avoiding slicing any bombs that may also appear.

## Features
Slicing Mechanism: Players can slice bamboos by swiping their mouse cursor across the screen.
Multiple bamboos: Different types of bamboos will appear, each with its own points value (Stand-By).
Bomb Avoidance: Bombs will occasionally appear among the bamboos; slicing a bomb will result in a game over.
Time Challenge: Players have a limited amount of time to slice as many bamboos as possible, before having to answer a question.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: 
Game Engine: (Phaser.js)
