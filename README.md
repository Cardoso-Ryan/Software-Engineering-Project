# Quiz Samurai
Welcome to Quiz Samurai! This is a web-based game project developed for our Software Engineering course at the University of Luxembourg. In this project, we've created a game inspired by the popular Fruit Ninja, but with our own unique twist.

## Introduction
Quiz Samurai is a fun and interactive game where players use a virtual samurai sword to slice various bamboos that fall from the top of the screen. 
The objective is simple: slice as many bamboos as possible while avoiding slicing any bombs that may also appear.

## Features
* Slicing Mechanism: Players can slice bamboos by swiping their mouse cursor across the screen.
* Multiple bamboos: Bamboos will keep falling down for the entirety of the game, while they also speed up with each increment of the level
* Bomb Avoidance: Bombs will occasionally appear among the bamboos; slicing a bomb will result in a loss of points.

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* Game Engine: Phaser3.js
