## Topics to Discussion:

## Discussion
1. `Existing Project`
- The Webpage has for now a Start Menu and can go to the Quiz or to the game.
When going to the quiz there are 3 possible choice for 3 diffrent Topics, when choosing a topic questions will apear and the user can answer them and at the end a score will apear.
When choosing the game the page will load directly in the game and the user can start playing, for the moment only one bamboo spawns and falls straight down. The speed is a fix number we can maybe add that the speed will varie between 1 and 3 randomly.

2. `FeedBack`
- Designing levels
   - The more you advance the faster the bamboos fall.
   - Each level has a different background and the more you advance, the smaller your cursor becomes.
- Adding sound/music.
- Implementing the leaderboard (name + score).


3. `Sprint 2 Objectives`
- Creating 3 different levels (Easy, Medium, Impossible)
    - Implementing a start screen where player can choose his difficulty.
    - Once in game, there will be no way back unless you lose or win.
- Trying to implement multiple bamboos spawn and maybe diffrent trajectories.
