2. `Existing Project`
- For the moment we have a main page with a canvas where we have objects that are animated and fell from up to down, when hitting the border of the canvas the object respawns on a random location, also we try to add that when "cutting" the object a smoke animation happens.
- We already created an background Image and our Logo, and we  are working with a basic design.
